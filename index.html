            <p>Thank you for taking the time to visit my portfolio page!  It is the first of many development projects I will undertake on my way to becoming a Full Stack Programming Expert.  My hope is that your experience on this site will give you confidence in my knowledge and skills, and that you'll consider me when looking for someone to produce a functional, reliable website from the ground up.</p>
            
            <p>I've always been fascinated with how things are engineered and put together.  This natural curiosity lead me to pursue a career in Information Technology.  My early focus was on hardware and networking, but as I began to play around with the internet and websites, I found that websites are more enjoyable to work with.</p>
            
            <p>To date, I have built almost a dozen websites for various organization and companies.  All of those sites rely on a CMS such as WordPress.  However, thanks to UCF Coding Bootcamp, my abilities have grown beyond these rudimentary tools, allowing me to completely manage, customize and control any website.</p>

            <p>Thank you again for visiting my page.  I hope to work with you soon!</p>
